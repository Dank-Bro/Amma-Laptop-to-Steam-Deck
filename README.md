# Amma Laptop to Steam Deck

This project is about transforming the Amma Laptop into a Steam Deck–style handheld gaming device.

And the best part? It’s much easier than most people think.

If you're planning to build this and complete it successfully, remember the **Two I’s**:

- **Interest** – You should genuinely enjoy the process.
- **Involvement** – You must be ready to fully commit and put in the effort.

With these two, you can absolutely make it happen.
