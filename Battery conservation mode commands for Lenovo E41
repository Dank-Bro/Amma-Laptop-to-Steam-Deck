## 🔋 Enabling Conservation Mode on Lenovo E41 (Driver Method)

On some Lenovo E41 variants, the **Conservation Mode** option does not appear by default in Lenovo Vantage.  
In this case, installing the correct Lenovo power management drivers enables the feature.

### ✅ Steps That Worked

1. Uninstall Lenovo Vantage (if already installed).
2. Download and install the following from Lenovo Support:
   - **Lenovo Energy Management Driver**
   - **Lenovo Power Management Driver**
   - **Lenovo ACPI / Hotkey Driver**
3. Restart the laptop.
4. Reinstall **Lenovo Vantage** from the Microsoft Store.
5. Open Lenovo Vantage → Device → Power.
6. Enable **Conservation Mode**.

After enabling, the battery will stop charging at around **55–60%**.

### 📌 Why This Works

Some Lenovo E41 models hide the battery threshold option unless:
- The correct ACPI power driver is installed
- The embedded controller communicates properly with Lenovo Vantage

Installing the proper drivers restores that functionality.

### ⚠️ Note

- Feature availability depends on BIOS version.
- Make sure your BIOS is updated to the latest stable version.
- Do not install random third-party battery limiter tools.

This method is confirmed working on supported Lenovo E41 variants.
